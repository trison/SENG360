Vulnerability Analysis

Threat 1 - The Java .class file can be decompiled, revealing the private key and verification method. The attacker can then generate a valid license.

Threat 2 - The digital signature is created at runtime using the supplied license file. Any license file with valid expiration date can then be placed in the directory, and a valid signature will be generated.
